## üìå Notes
- Ensure that foreign key constraints are respected while inserting data.
- All monetary values are represented using `DECIMAL(10,2)` for currency precision.
- RAM, ROM, and SSD fields store string values like `'16GB'`, `'512GB'`, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ Future Enhancements
- Add stock management and inventory control.
- Create stored procedures for automated reports.
- Integrate with visualization tools for dashboards.
